def integrate_trace_distance(systems, reference) -> list:

    """
    Takes a list of QuantumSystem objects and calculates their
    trace distances at each timestep with respect to a reference
    QuantumSystem. This curve is then integrated over the time
    period the dynamics are evaluated for, and returns this value
    divided by the number of timesteps. All systems and reference
    must be initialised with the same number of sites, timesteps,
    and time_interval. Integration approximated using trapezoid
    rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    systems : list of QuantumSystem
        The QuantumSystem objects whose trace distance with respect
        to the reference QuantumSystem at each timestep will be
        evaluated.
    reference : QuantumSystem
        The reference QuantumSystem object.

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        The integrated trace distance for each QuantumSystem in
        'systems' with respect to the 'reference' QuantumSystem.
